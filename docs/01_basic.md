# Linear Search

Let's start by analyzing the simplest algorithm that does something non-trivial: linear search. Most of these algorithsm work on the simplest data structure that we will see, the sequence.

A sequence (`Sequence` class) is an abstract data type that represents a collection of items with no inherent structure, other than each element has an index.

```python {export=src/codex/search/linear.py}
from typing import Sequence

```

Linear search is the most basic form of search. We have a sequence of elements, and we must determine whether one specific element is among them. Since we cannot assume anything at all from the sequence, our only option is to check them all.

```python {export=src/codex/search/linear.py}
def find[T](x:T, items: Sequence[T]) -> bool:
    for y in items:
        if x == y:
            return True

    return False

```
Our first test will be a sanity check for simple cases:

```python {export=tests/search/test_linear.py}
from codex.search.linear import find

def test_simple_list():
    assert find(1, [1,2,3]) is True
    assert find(2, [1,2,3]) is True
    assert find(3, [1,2,3]) is True
    assert find(4, [1,2,3]) is False

```
